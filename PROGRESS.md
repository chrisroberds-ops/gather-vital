## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite 5 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v3 (NOT v4) |
| Routing | React Router v6 (`createBrowserRouter`) |
| Testing | Vitest 2 + Testing Library + jsdom 24 |
| Backend (prod) | Firebase 10 modular SDK |
| Backend (dev) | Full in-memory stub, no credentials needed |
| Test data | `@faker-js/faker` seeded at 42, generated to `src/test-data/*.json` |

**Run commands:**
```bash
VITE_TEST_MODE=true npm run dev    # full app, no Firebase needed
npx vitest run                     # all 276 tests
npx tsc --noEmit                   # type check
npx vite build                     # production build
node print-server/index.js         # label print server (requires .env)
node scripts/generate-test-data.js # regenerate seed data
```

## Architecture Decisions (Critical — Read Before Changing Anything)

### TEST_MODE
`VITE_TEST_MODE=true` (set in `.env.development`) switches the entire `db` export in `src/services/index.ts` from Firebase to an in-memory store seeded from JSON files. The app runs fully without any Google/Firebase credentials.

### Service Layer
`src/services/db-interface.ts` defines `DatabaseService`. `in-memory-db.ts` and `firebase-db.ts` both implement it. `src/services/index.ts` exports `db` — the active implementation.

### Auth / Guards
`src/auth/guards.tsx` holds a module-level `currentUser` variable. Loaders run synchronously relative to `navigate()`, so this variable must be set **synchronously before** calling `navigate()`. See `LoginPage.tsx` and `AdminLayout.tsx`.

`authReady` (from `AuthContext.tsx`) is a promise that resolves immediately in TEST_MODE so loaders never hang.

### Tier-Based Access
Five tiers: `Public(0) < Authenticated(1) < GroupLeader(2) < Staff(3) < Executive(4)` + `isFinanceAdmin` flag.
`src/shared/utils/tierNav.ts` is the single source of truth for which path each tier calls home:
- Public → `/public`
- Authenticated → `/my`
- GroupLeader → `/leader`
- Staff/Executive → `/admin`

### Multi-Tenancy
`src/services/church-context.ts` holds a module-level `_churchId` variable (default `TEST_CHURCH_ID = 'church-test-default'`). Every DB read/write is automatically scoped to the active church. `setChurchId()` is called by `AuthContext` on login and by the setup wizard after church creation. `_churchId` is also persisted to `localStorage` under `gather:church_id` so kiosk tablets survive page refreshes.

### AppConfig & Branding
`src/services/app-config-context.tsx` provides `AppConfigProvider` and `useAppConfig()`. On load and on every update it calls `applyPrimaryColor(hex)`, which converts the hex to HSL and writes 10 CSS custom properties (`--color-primary-50` through `--color-primary-900`) to `document.documentElement`. Tailwind's `bg-primary-*` / `text-primary-*` classes reference these variables, so the entire app recolors at runtime without any component changes.

### Cross-Tab Sync (Kiosk ↔ Staff Dashboard ↔ Display)
Three mechanisms layered:
1. **BroadcastChannel** (`src/services/checkin-event-bus.ts`) — events in Tab A reach Tab B instantly.
2. **localStorage persistence** — sessions, checkins, newly registered people, pickup queue, Church entities, and AppConfig all written to localStorage so any tab can read them.
3. **2-second polling fallback** — display page polls `getActivePickupQueue()` every 2s for cross-device support.

localStorage keys used:
- `gather:church_id` — active church ID (restored on page load)
- `gather_open_session` — current `CheckinSession` object (JSON)
- `gather_checkins_{sessionId}` — `Checkin[]` for that session
- `gather_person_{id}` — individual `Person` objects for cross-tab registered people
- `gather_kiosk_id` — kiosk identity string (e.g. `"kiosk-1"`)
- `gather_pickup_queue` — `PickupQueueEntry[]` for the lobby display
- `gather_church_overrides` — Church entity overrides (name, slug) written by setup wizard / settings
- `gather_app_config_{churchId}` — AppConfig snapshot per church, written by `updateAppConfig`
- `gather_service_plans` — all ServicePlan records (cross-tab for Music Stand)
- `gather_service_plan_items` — all ServicePlanItem records (cross-tab for Music Stand)
- `gather_service_assignments` — all ServiceAssignment records (cross-tab for Music Stand)
- `gather_songs` — all Song records (cross-tab: songs created in admin visible in Music Stand)

**Do not bypass these mechanisms.** Use the cross-tab-aware helpers:
- `getOpenSession()` — reads localStorage first, falls back to `db.getCheckinSessions()`
- `getSessionCheckins(sessionId)` — reads localStorage first
- `getPersonCrossTab(id)` — tries `db.getPerson()`, falls back to localStorage
- `findCheckinInStorage(checkinId)` — scans all `gather_checkins_*` keys
- `getActivePickupQueue()` — reads localStorage, auto-prunes entries older than 2 hours

Routes: `/admin/groups`, `/admin/events`, `/embed/groups`, `/embed/events`.

---

## Multi-Tenancy Refactor ✅ Complete

**+18 tests (136 total).** All 20 entity interfaces carry `church_id`. Every DB read/write scoped to active church. Setup wizard calls `db.createChurch()` and `setChurchId()`. `AppUser` gains `church_id`. Global church CRUD methods unscoped for super-admin use.

Key files: `src/services/church-context.ts`, `src/shared/types/index.ts` (all interfaces), `src/services/in-memory-db.ts` (`inChurch()` + `stamp()`).

---

**+21 tests (163 total).** Notification service (email + SMS), visitor follow-up pipeline, admin dashboard with 6 live widgets.

Key files: `src/services/notification-service.ts`, `src/features/visitors/visitor-service.ts`, `src/features/visitors/VisitorPipeline.tsx`, `src/features/dashboard/AdminDashboard.tsx`.

Routes: `/admin`, `/admin/visitors`, `/embed/visitor-form`.

---

## Phase 6 — Church Settings, Setup Wizard & Production Reliability ✅ Complete

**+25 tests (188 total).** Full multi-step setup wizard, comprehensive settings page, allergy auto-alert, notification service production paths, label print server.

### 6A — Setup Wizard (`/setup`) — 10 steps, 9 numbered sections

**Progress indicator:** A segmented bar across the top shows all 9 sections. Each "Next →" saves immediately to the DB — progress is not lost if the admin stops mid-wizard. Once church identity is saved (Section 1), the wizard header shows the church's own name and logo instead of any Gather branding.

| # | Section | What it configures |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Identity | Church name (required), address, phone, website, logo URL, congregation term |
| 2 | Modules | Feature flag toggles for each major module |
| 3 | Branding | Primary + secondary color with presets, custom picker, live preview |
| 4 | Service Times | Day/time/label, multi-campus toggle, adult attendance tracking toggle |
| 5 | Kids Ministry | Age/grade rooms, label print fields, auto-flag allergy toggle, pickup policy, kiosk count |
| 6 | Groups | Group types, labels, leader-sees-roster toggle, signup-requires-approval toggle |
| 7 | Volunteers | Serving teams list, schedule cadence, scheduling method, notification method |
| 8 | Communications | Primary outreach, follow-up steps, follow-up owner, weekly report toggle |
| 9 | Dashboard | Metric checkboxes, year-over-year comparison toggle |

### 6B — Settings Page (`/admin/settings`)
Sidebar-nav with 8+ independent sections matching the wizard. Each section has its own Save button.

### 6C — AppConfig Type (28 fields)
Full field list in prior sessions — `church_name`, `logo_url`, `primary_color`, `service_times[]`, `kids_rooms[]`, `serving_teams[]`, `modules`, `setup_complete`, and ~20 more.

### 6D — Allergy / Medical Auto-Alert
`MedicalAlertBanner.tsx` — auto-triggers from `child.allergies` or `child.medical_notes`, red banner with Acknowledge button, dismisses per session.

### 6E — Notification Service (Production Paths)
`sendSMS` warns + returns (non-fatal); `sendEmail` calls Resend API with `VITE_RESEND_API_KEY`.

### 6F — Label Print Server (`print-server/`)
Self-contained Node 18+ server. `POST /print` → ZPL → PrintNode API in parallel for child badge + parent tag. Separate printer IDs for dual-printer setups. Configured via `print-server/.env`.

### 6G — Kiosk & Embed Color Fix
`KioskLayout.tsx` and `EmbedLayout.tsx` both apply `applyPrimaryColor()`. Embeds detect `?church=<slug>` and call `db.getChurchBySlug()` → `setChurchId()` → `reloadConfig()` before rendering.

---

## Session C — Live Pickup Display ✅ Complete (2026-04-09)

**+7 tests (235 total).** Baseline: 228 tests.

### What was built

| File | What changed |
|---|---|
| `src/shared/types/index.ts` | Added `PickupQueueEntry` interface |
| `src/services/db-interface.ts` | Added `getPickupQueue`, `createPickupQueueEntry`, `clearPickupQueueEntry` |
| `src/services/in-memory-db.ts` | Implemented 3 new pickup queue methods; added Church entity localStorage overrides layer (`gather_church_overrides`); added AppConfig localStorage persistence (`gather_app_config_{churchId}`) so display tab reads admin tab's saved config |
| `src/services/firebase-db.ts` | Added `notImplemented` stubs for 3 new methods |
| `src/services/checkin-event-bus.ts` | Added `'pickup_queue_updated'` to `CheckinEventType` |
| `src/services/print-service.ts` | Added `printCheckoutSlip()` (console.group in TEST_MODE; PrintNode TODO for production) |
| `src/features/display/pickup-queue-service.ts` | `getActivePickupQueue` (with 2-hour auto-expiry + localStorage prune), `addToPickupQueue`, `clearPickupEntry`; console.log at entry of `addToPickupQueue` |
| `src/features/display/PickupDisplay.tsx` | Full-screen `/display` page — two-component pattern (outer resolves `?church=<slug>`, inner mounts after config is fully applied); brand-colored header; queue list with child name/room/time-ago/pickup-code; two-click confirmation Clear button; polls every 2s + subscribes to `checkinBus` for instant updates |
| `src/features/checkin/CheckoutPanel.tsx` | `handleLookup` now calls `addToPickupQueue` immediately after valid code match (child appears on display); `handleConfirmCheckout` calls `clearPickupEntry` after checkout completes (child disappears from display); matched state carries `queueEntryId` |
| `src/features/checkin/checkin-service.ts` | `performCheckout` calls `printCheckoutSlip` only (non-fatal); `addToPickupQueue` removed from this function — it now lives in the UI layer at lookup time |
| `src/App.tsx` | Added lazy import + `/display` route (no auth, no layout) |
| `src/tests/pickup-queue-service.test.ts` | 7 new tests |

### Pickup queue workflow (as-built)

1. Staff enters 4-digit code → clicks **Look Up** → child identified → `addToPickupQueue()` called → **child name appears on lobby TV immediately**
2. Staff clicks **Check Out** → `clearPickupEntry()` called → **child name removed from TV automatically**
3. `/display` is unauthenticated, full-screen, brand-colored — designed to run on a lobby TV or iPad
4. `?church=<slug>` param resolves the church at display time; brand color and church name applied before any content renders
5. Entries auto-expire after 2 hours — pruned from localStorage on every `getActivePickupQueue()` call
6. Staff two-click Clear button on display is a safety valve for stuck entries: first click → "Confirm?" (red), second click → removes from localStorage across all screens

### Tests added (Session C)

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `src/tests/pickup-queue-service.test.ts` | 7 | `createPickupQueueEntry` fields; excludes cleared; sorted oldest-first; `clearPickupEntry` marks cleared; `sessionId` filter; appears after add; DB round-trip |

### Post-session C fixes (same day, 2026-04-09)

These bugs were found during manual testing and fixed in the same session:

| Bug | Root cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Pickup queue empty on display (cross-tab) | `store.pickupQueue` is per-tab; display tab never sees staff tab's in-memory entries | Added localStorage persistence in `pickup-queue-service.ts` (`gather_pickup_queue`) |
| Display showed "Grace Community Church" instead of configured name | `store.appConfigs` is per-tab; display tab loaded seed config; `reloadConfig()` read the wrong store | Added `gather_app_config_{churchId}` localStorage persistence in `in-memory-db.ts`; split `PickupDisplay` into outer (resolver) + inner (content) components so inner mounts after config is applied |
| Church entity slug not found cross-tab | `store.churches` is per-tab; setup wizard updated admin tab but display tab had seed data | Added `gather_church_overrides` localStorage layer to all Church CRUD methods |
| Setup wizard not creating Church entity | `if (!config.setup_complete)` guard prevented execution (seed data has `setup_complete: true`) | Changed to always call `db.getChurch()` and conditionally create or update |
| `addToPickupQueue` appeared not to be called | No console output in the function | Added `console.log('[Gather] addToPickupQueue called', input)` at function entry |
| Stale entry from previous session stuck on display | No expiry mechanism; entry persisted indefinitely in localStorage | Added `QUEUE_EXPIRY_MS = 2 hours` in `getActivePickupQueue`; expired entries pruned from localStorage on every read |
| Staff had no way to manually remove stuck entries | Clear button was removed in workflow redesign | Restored Clear button to display with two-click confirmation pattern |

### Post-session C additions (2026-04-10)

**Logo upload feature** — no new tests; 235 tests still pass.

| File | What changed |
|---|---|
| `src/services/storage-service.ts` | New. `uploadLogo(file)`: validates type (PNG/JPG) and size (≤2 MB); in TEST_MODE converts to base64 data URL via `FileReader` and console.logs; in prod uploads to Firebase Storage and returns the download URL. `validateLogoFile` exported separately for inline form validation. |
| `src/shared/components/LogoUpload.tsx` | New. Upload button (dashed border, `🖼️` icon) when no logo set; 64px preview with "Replace logo" + "Remove" actions when one is. Handles uploading state (spinner, disabled), validation errors, and upload errors inline. |
| `src/features/setup/SetupWizard.tsx` | Step1Identity: URL text input replaced with `LogoUpload`. StepDone: logo thumbnail shown in the confirmation summary above the other config rows when a logo is set. |
| `src/features/settings/ChurchSettings.tsx` | IdentitySection: URL text input + manual preview replaced with `LogoUpload`. |
| `src/features/visitors/VisitorForm.tsx` | Added `useAppConfig()`. Logo rendered above the "Welcome" heading when set; heading text changes to "Welcome to [Church Name]!" when a name is configured. |
| `src/features/kiosk/PhoneEntry.tsx` | Added `useAppConfig()`. Logo replaces the wave emoji `👋` when set; church name replaces the "Welcome!" h1. |
| `src/services/notification-service.ts` | `EmailPayload` gains optional `logoUrl?: string`. When provided, a `html` field is added to the Resend request body with the logo in the email header. `text` is always sent unchanged — existing tests and plain-text clients unaffected. |

**Locations already using `config.logo_url` (no changes needed):**
- `AdminLayout.tsx` — sidebar header (desktop + mobile top bar)
- `PickupDisplay.tsx` — lobby TV brand header and empty-state watermark

#### Bug Fix — Plan List Shows No Plans (resolved 2026-04-15)

**Root cause (confirmed via diagnostic logs):** Music Stand opens in a new browser tab. Each tab has its own JS environment and in-memory store. Plans created in the admin tab existed only in that tab's `store.servicePlans` — the stand tab's store started empty. This is the same cross-tab isolation problem previously solved for check-ins, pickup queue, and app config.

**Fix:** Added localStorage persistence for `servicePlans`, `servicePlanItems`, and `serviceAssignments` in `in-memory-db.ts`, following the identical pattern used for AppConfig and Church overrides:
- On every write (create / update / delete / reorder) → `writeLs(key, storeArray)`
- On every read (get / getBy) → `mergeIntoStore(storeArray, readLs(key))` before filtering
- `mergeIntoStore` adds any persisted record not already present in the store by `id` — idempotent and safe to call on every read

**Previous fix attempts** (rounds 1–4) addressed `church_id` mismatches that were real but secondary — they are still correctly applied. The primary cause was always the separate tab store.

**New localStorage keys:**
- `gather_service_plans` — all ServicePlan records
- `gather_service_plan_items` — all ServicePlanItem records
- `gather_service_assignments` — all ServiceAssignment records

This persistence is implicit TEST_MODE-only: `in-memory-db.ts` is only used when `VITE_TEST_MODE=true`; production uses Firebase which handles cross-tab data automatically.

---

## Session E — Small Group Attendance ✅ Complete (2026-04-15)

**+19 tests (295 total).** Baseline: 276 tests.

### What was built

#### New Types (`src/shared/types/index.ts`)

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `GroupMeeting` | One meeting instance per group: `{ id, church_id, group_id, date, notes?, created_at }` |
| `GroupAttendance` | Per-person attendance record for a meeting: `{ id, church_id, meeting_id, person_id, status }` |
| `GroupAttendanceStatus` | `'present' \| 'absent' \| 'excused'` |

#### New DB Methods (`src/services/db-interface.ts` + implementations)

- `getGroupMeetings(groupId)`, `getGroupMeeting(id)`, `createGroupMeeting`, `updateGroupMeeting`, `deleteGroupMeeting`
- `getGroupAttendance(meetingId)`, `upsertGroupAttendance(data)` — upsert is idempotent by (meeting_id, person_id)
- All 7 methods have `notImplemented` stubs in `firebase-db.ts`

#### New Service (`src/features/groups/group-attendance-service.ts`)

| Export | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `createMeeting` | Create a GroupMeeting for a group |
| `getMeetings` | List meetings for a group (newest-first) |
| `updateMeeting` | Update meeting date/notes |
| `deleteMeeting` | Delete meeting + all its attendance records |
| `saveAttendance` | Upsert a full set of attendance records for a meeting |
| `getMeetingAttendance` | Raw attendance records for one meeting |
| `getMeetingsWithAttendance` | Enriched list: meeting + presentCount + totalCount |
| `getGroupAttendanceRate` | Overall rate: present / (meetings × members) |
| `getMemberAttendanceRates` | Per-member rates across all meetings, sorted desc |
| `exportGroupAttendanceCsv` | CSV string with Date, Notes, Member Name, Status columns |

#### New UI Files

| File | Route / Purpose |
|------|----------------|
| `src/features/groups/GroupDetail.tsx` | `/admin/groups/:id` — group detail with Members + Attendance tabs |

**Attendance tab features:**
- Summary stat cards: meetings logged, overall attendance %, members tracked
- "+ Log meeting" button → modal with date picker, optional notes, and per-member present/absent toggles (all-present / all-absent shortcuts)
- Meeting history list (newest-first, collapsible) — each row shows date, notes, present/total count
- Inline attendance editor in each history row — re-mark and save without opening a new modal
- Per-member attendance rates table (color-coded: ≥75% green, ≥50% yellow, <50% red)
- "Export CSV" button downloads a CSV file with one row per attendance record
- Delete meeting (with confirmation) removes the meeting and all its records

**Members tab:** full roster with status management, add/remove — lifted from GroupsDirectory expanded row.

#### Integration with GroupsDirectory

`GroupsDirectory.tsx`: added "Attendance →" button to the expanded group row's action bar, linking to `/admin/groups/:id`.

#### Route

`/admin/groups/:id` — requires `GroupLeader` tier (tier ≥ 2), wrapped in `ModuleGuard module="groups"`.

### Tests added (Session E)

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/tests/group-attendance-service.test.ts` | 19 | Meeting CRUD; attendance save/upsert; getMeetingsWithAttendance; rate calculations (group + per-member); rate sorting; active-member-only filter; CSV header-only; CSV column order; CSV row order; CSV quote escaping |

## Session F — Song Import ✅ Complete (2026-04-15)

**+35 tests (330 total).** Baseline: 295 tests.

### What was built

#### localStorage persistence for songs (`src/services/in-memory-db.ts`)

All four Song DB methods (`getSongs`, `getSong`, `createSong`, `updateSong`, `deleteSong`) now use the same `mergeIntoStore` / `writeLs` pattern as service plans. Songs created in the admin tab (e.g. via the song library or import) are immediately visible in Music Stand tabs opened separately.

New localStorage key: `gather_songs`

#### New Service (`src/features/worship/song-import-service.ts`)

| Export | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `parseCsv` | Shared CSV parser — handles quotes, escaped quotes, CRLF, empty rows |
| `SONG_FIELDS` | Canonical list of importable song fields (title required; artist, key, BPM, CCLI, tags, lyrics optional) |
| `isPlanningCenterCsv` | Detects PC export by checking headers against known PC column names |
| `buildPlanningCenterMapping` | Auto-maps PC column names (Title, Author, Author/Artist, BPM, CCLI Number, Themes, etc.) |
| `buildAutoMapping` | Auto-maps generic CSV headers by label/key similarity |
| `buildSongPreview` | Builds preview rows with `ready / duplicate / skipped` status |
| `commitSongImport` | Imports all `ready` rows; returns `{ imported, skipped, duplicates }` |

**Duplicate detection rule:** a song is flagged as a duplicate if an existing active song matches on title (case-insensitive). When both the incoming row and the existing song have a CCLI number, the title+CCLI pair is checked first (stricter), falling back to title-only. This avoids false positives while catching the common case of re-importing the same song.

#### New UI (`src/features/worship/SongImportModal.tsx`)

4-step modal wizard:

| Step | Planning Center | Generic CSV |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| Upload | Drop or browse CSV | Drop or browse CSV |
| Map Fields | **Skipped** — auto-mapped | Manual column → field dropdowns |
| Preview | Traffic-light summary (Ready / Duplicate / Skipped), scrollable row table | Same |
| Done | Imported / duplicate / skipped counts | Same |

- PC import detected automatically from headers — mapping step skipped, "Planning Center import detected" badge shown on preview
- Duplicate rows shown with yellow highlight and tooltip showing which existing song matched
- "Import N songs" button disabled when all rows are duplicates or skipped

#### Integration (`src/features/worship/SongLibrary.tsx`)

Added "Import" button (with download icon) in the header bar next to "Add Song". Clicking opens the `SongImportModal`. After a successful import the song list reloads automatically.

### Tests added (Session F)

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/tests/song-import-service.test.ts` | 35 | CSV parser (quotes, CRLF, commas-in-quotes, escaping, empty rows); PC detection (known/unknown headers); PC mapping (all column variants); auto-mapping (key match, case-insensitive, ignore fallback); duplicate detection (exact title, case-insensitive, with/without CCLI, mixed statuses); commit (counts, field mapping, bad BPM, all-duplicate); SONG_FIELDS shape |

---

## Session G — Household Checkout, File Attachments, PC CSV & Music Stand ✅ Complete (2026-04-16)

**+30 tests (360 total).** Baseline: 330 tests.

### What was built

#### 1. Household Grouped Checkout with Authorization Controls

**Types added (`src/shared/types/index.ts`):**
- `HouseholdMember.authorized_children: string[]` — list of child IDs this member is authorized to pick up
- `HouseholdMember.pickup_notes?: string` — free-text notes shown to staff at checkout

**DB methods added:**
- `getHouseholdCheckoutGroup(churchId, householdId)` — returns all checked-in children for a household grouped together, enabling single-scan multi-child checkout

**UI changes:**
- `CheckoutPanel` — redesigned to show all household children in a grouped card; staff sees each child's photo, room, and authorization status in one view
- `AuthorizationForm` in `HouseholdManager` — staff can mark which adults are authorized for each child, and add pickup notes
- `HouseholdSummary` — new badges showing authorization count and pickup notes indicator

**Tests added:** 11 tests in `src/tests/household-checkout.test.ts` covering grouped fetch, authorization filtering, notes display, and edge cases (no children checked in, unauthorized adult, partial authorization).

#### 2. PDF and Audio File Attachments for Songs

**New service functions (`src/services/storage-service.ts`):**

| Export | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `validateSongPdf(file)` | Size check (≤ 10 MB), MIME type check |
| `uploadSongPdf(songId, file)` | TEST_MODE: base64 data URL; prod: Firebase Storage upload |
| `validateSongAudio(file)` | Size check (≤ 50 MB), MP3/M4A MIME check |
| `uploadSongAudio(songId, file)` | TEST_MODE: base64 data URL; prod: Firebase Storage upload |

**UI changes (`src/features/worship/SongForm.tsx`):**
- New `SongFileAttachments` component with drag-and-drop zones for PDF and audio
- Files upload immediately on drop/select (not on form save) via `updateSong`
- Shows file list with remove buttons; TEST_MODE notice explains data-URL storage
- Read-only chord chart text preview shown in edit mode when `chord_chart_text` is present

**`mergeIntoStore` fix (`src/services/in-memory-db.ts`):**
- Previously only *added* new records, never replaced existing ones — seed songs edited in localStorage (e.g. `chord_chart_url` set on `song-amazing-grace`) were silently ignored on reload
- Fixed to replace existing records with the persisted (localStorage) version: localStorage is the source of truth in TEST_MODE

#### 3. PC CSV Importer — Multi-line Chord Charts & Multiple Arrangements

**RFC-4180 compliant CSV parser (`src/features/worship/song-import-service.ts`):**
- Rewrote `parseCsv` to parse character-by-character; newlines inside quoted fields are part of the field value and do NOT start a new row
- Previously: a chord chart with 40 lines of text would create 40 song records from one CSV row

**`chord_chart_text` field:**
- Added `chord_chart_text?: string` to `Song` type
- Added `chord_chart_text` to `SONG_FIELDS` and `PC_COLUMN_MAP` (`'arrangement 1 chord chart'`, `'chord chart'`)
- `commitSongImport` saves `chord_chart_text`; key normalization takes only the first key from "G, Ab, F#m"-style values

**Planning Center multiple arrangements (`applyPcTransforms`):**
- Each CSV row is exactly one song (Arrangement 1 = primary)
- Arrangement 2–4 names and primary keys → "Also available: Acoustic (Ab), Rock (D)" note prepended to `chord_chart_text`
- Arrangement 2–4 chord chart text intentionally ignored
- Themes column leading `, ` stripped (PC always emits `, Adoration, Creator`)

**Import preview:** chord chart snippet column added to preview table for PC imports.

**Tests added:** 19 tests in `src/tests/song-import-service.test.ts` covering multi-line quoted fields, Themes stripping, arrangement note building (2/3/4 arrangements, no-key fallback), PC column mapping, `chord_chart_text` commit, key normalization, and 4-arrangement end-to-end (one CSV row → exactly one song record).

#### 4. Chord Chart Text View in Music Stand

**New component (`src/features/stand/SongView.tsx` — `ChordChartTextView`):**
- Dark background, monospace font, `whitespace-pre-wrap`, 18px base size × zoom multiplier
- Indicator banner: "Text chord chart — upload a PDF for annotation support"
- Zoom controls (A+/A−) active in text view; same zoom state as PDF view
- Auto-initializes to text view when no PDFs exist but `chord_chart_text` is present
- "T" toggle button shown when song has both a PDF and chord chart text — PDF is default when both exist
- Metronome and audio player remain accessible in text view

### Tests added (Session G)

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/tests/household-checkout.test.ts` | 11 | Grouped fetch, authorization filtering, pickup notes, edge cases |
| `src/tests/song-import-service.test.ts` | +19 | RFC-4180 multi-line parser, Themes cleanup, arrangement notes, PC columns, chord_chart_text commit |

---

## Session H — PDF.js Rendering, Annotation Canvas & Local QR Codes ✅ Complete (2026-04-17)

**+10 tests (370 total).** Baseline: 360 tests.

### What was built

#### PDF.js loader (`src/features/stand/pdf-js-loader.ts`)

- Dynamically injects a `<script>` tag for PDF.js 3.11.174 from the CDN on first use
- Sets `GlobalWorkerOptions.workerSrc` to the matching worker CDN URL
- Caches the load promise — CDN request happens at most once per page lifetime
- Returns `true` if ready, `false` if CDN is unreachable (offline / blocked)

#### `PdfViewer.tsx` — complete rewrite

**Removed:** `<iframe>` / placeholder `PageFrame` component
**Added:**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `PdfPageWithAnnotations` | Renders one PDF page to a `<canvas>` via PDF.js, with a transparent SVG annotation layer on top |
| `AnnotationShape` | Renders saved `pen`/`highlighter` paths and `text` elements inside the SVG layer |
| `FallbackIframe` | Used when PDF.js CDN is unreachable — same `<iframe>` behaviour as before |

**PDF rendering:**
- `page.getViewport({ scale: 1.5 })` → canvas is 1.5× PDF native resolution
- `canvas.style.width = '100%'; height = 'auto'` → fills container at correct aspect ratio
- Dark mode via CSS `filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg)` on the canvas element (zero re-renders)
- Loading spinner shown until `renderTask.promise` resolves
- Render task cancelled via `renderTask.cancel()` on page change / unmount to prevent memory leaks

**SVG annotation layer:**
- `viewBox="0 0 {canvasWidth} {canvasHeight}"` with `preserveAspectRatio="none"` → annotation coordinates are in PDF canvas pixel space
- `svg.getScreenCTM().inverse()` converts pointer clientX/Y to SVG coordinates — automatically accounts for the zoom CSS transform on the parent container
- `setPointerCapture()` ensures smooth pen/highlighter paths when cursor leaves the SVG mid-stroke
- `pen` and `highlighter`: path built incrementally as `M x y L x y ...`, saved on `pointerup` if the path has at least one segment (`L`)
- `text`: click shows a `<foreignObject>` input at the click coordinates; Enter or blur commits the annotation as `JSON.stringify({ text, x, y })`
- SVG `pointerEvents: none` when no tool is active — tap-to-navigate pass-through works as before

**Annotation storage (unchanged service layer):**
- `createAnnotation` called on drawing completion; result pushed to local state
- `getAnnotationsForSong` loads all annotations for the current user + song + PDF URL on mount
- Other-user annotations rendered at 40% opacity (same as before)

**All existing features preserved:**
- Keyboard / foot-pedal navigation (arrow keys)
- Pinch-to-zoom with zoom level persisted per user per PDF
- Page reorder controls
- Two-page landscape layout
- Session sync (page turns via `standBus`)
- Edge-tap navigation

#### New tests (`src/tests/music-stand-service.test.ts`) — +10

| Suite | Tests |
|-------|-------|
| `annotation storage — page-level filtering` | page_number preserved on create; all pages returned when no filter; client-side page filter (PdfViewer pattern); multiple annotations same page |
| `annotation storage — SVG path and text data formats` | pen SVG path preserved exactly; highlighter path preserved; text JSON with position stored/retrieved; color retained |
| `annotation storage — session persistence simulation` | annotations from prior calls visible on subsequent fetch; delete one page doesn't affect others |

#### Local QR code generation (`src/features/embeds/EmbedsPage.tsx`)

Replaced `api.qrserver.com` external service with the `qrcode` npm package (v1.5.4):

- **`QrCanvas` component** — renders a QR code to a `<canvas>` element via `QRCode.toCanvas()` in a `useEffect`; re-renders automatically when the embed URL changes
- **`downloadQr`** — uses `QRCode.toDataURL()` to produce a PNG data URL locally, then triggers a download via a temporary `<a>` element click; no network request, no CORS issue, works offline
- Removed `qrImageUrl()` helper and the `fetch()` → blob → object-URL chain
- Package installed: `qrcode@1.5.4` + `@types/qrcode`

---

## Session I — Email System, Merge Fields, Confirmation Tokens & Volunteer Attendance ✅ Complete (2026-04-18)

**+56 tests (426 total).** Baseline: 370 tests.

### What was built

#### Part 1 — Email Provider Setup

**New `AppConfig` fields (`src/shared/types/index.ts`):**
- `email_provider?: 'gmail' | 'resend'`
- `gmail_address?: string`
- `gmail_app_password?: string` — stored for future server-side proxy; browser SMTP impossible
- `resend_api_key?: string` — overrides `VITE_RESEND_API_KEY` env var when set

**`notification-service.ts` rewrite:**
- Reads `email_provider` from `AppConfig` at send time (lazy import to avoid circular dep)
- Gmail path: logs `console.warn`, does NOT throw (same pattern as Twilio SMS)
- Resend path: uses AppConfig key with fallback to env var
- Added `replaceMergeFields(template, ctx)` and `MERGE_FIELDS` documentation array

**New Settings section (`src/features/settings/ChurchSettings.tsx`):**
- `EmailSection` — provider toggle (Resend / Gmail SMTP), per-provider credential fields, Gmail App Password help link, "Send test email" button with success/failure feedback

#### Part 2 — Merge Fields

| Token | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `{first_name}` | Recipient's first name |
| `{last_name}` | Recipient's last name |
| `{church_name}` | Church name from settings |
| `{service_date}` | Scheduled service date (volunteers) |
| `{role}` | Volunteer role or team position |
| `{event_name}` | Event name |
| `{group_name}` | Group name |

- Missing context values replaced with empty string (graceful fallback)
- All occurrences of each token replaced (not just first)

#### Part 3 — Confirmation Token System

**New type (`src/shared/types/index.ts`):**
- `ConfirmationToken` — `{ id, church_id, token, person_id, reference_id, purpose, expires_at, used_at?, used_action?, role?, service_date?, event_name?, group_name?, church_name? }`
- `ConfirmationPurpose = 'volunteer' | 'event' | 'group_waitlist'`

**New DB methods (interface + in-memory + Firebase stubs):**
- `getConfirmationToken(token)`, `createConfirmationToken(data)`, `useConfirmationToken(token, action)`

**New service (`src/services/confirmation-token-service.ts`):**
- `createVolunteerConfirmToken`, `createEventConfirmToken`, `createGroupWaitlistConfirmToken`
- `resolveConfirmationToken(tokenString, action)` — validates, marks used, performs DB action
- 7-day expiry, single-use guarantee
- `confirmUrl()` / `declineUrl()` helpers

**New page (`src/features/public-pages/ConfirmPage.tsx`):**
- Route: `/confirm?token=...&action=confirm|decline` (no auth required)
- States: loading, success (purpose-specific message), already_used, expired, not_found
- Registered in `App.tsx`

#### Part 4 — Volunteer Attendance

**New `VolunteerSchedule` fields:**
- `served?: boolean` — `undefined` = not marked, `true` = served, `false` = no-show
- `served_at?: string` — ISO-8601 timestamp when marked

**New service functions (`src/features/volunteers/volunteer-service.ts`):**
- `markServed(id, served: boolean | null)` — mark/unmark attendance; `null` clears the mark
- `getServedVolunteersInMonth(year, month)` — unique person count for Monthly Vital Signs Report

**`ScheduleView.tsx` — attendance column:**
- New `showAttendance` prop (default `false`); set to `true` in coordinator view
- Per-row `AttendanceCell`: green ✓ button, gray ✗ button, undo link after marking
- Per-date summary line: "X of Y confirmed as served · N not yet marked"
- Spinner shown on the cell being updated (not whole row)

### Tests added (Session I)

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/tests/merge-fields.test.ts` | 20 | All 7 tokens, multi-token templates, repeated tokens, missing/empty context, unknown tokens, MERGE_FIELDS array |
| `src/tests/confirmation-token.test.ts` | 21 | URL helpers, volunteer/event/group token creation, confirm/decline for all 3 purposes, expiry (fake timers), already_used, not_found, single-use guarantee |
| `src/tests/volunteer-attendance.test.ts` | 16 | `markServed` (true/false/null/flip/undo/scope), `getServedVolunteersInMonth` (deduplication, no-shows excluded, unmarked excluded, month boundaries, zero case) |
| `src/tests/notification-service-prod.test.ts` | updated | Updated mock to include `getAppConfig`, updated warning message to match new multi-provider code |

---

## Manually Verified (as of 2026-04-09)

The following flows were confirmed working end-to-end in the running app (`VITE_TEST_MODE=true`):

- **Setup wizard** — runs 9 sections, creates Church entity with correct slug, saves AppConfig, redirects to `/admin` with church name and brand color applied
- **Check-in kiosk** — phone lookup, child selection, label print stub fires, cross-tab checkin visible on staff dashboard immediately
- **Staff checkout** → child appears on `/display` lobby TV the moment code is looked up (before Check Out is clicked)
- **Check Out button** → child disappears from `/display` automatically, print checkout slip stub fires
- **`/display?church=the-venues`** — correctly loads "The Venues" config (brand color, church name) in a fresh tab with no prior auth
- **Cross-tab pickup queue** — staff tab writes to localStorage; display tab in separate browser tab reads it within 2 seconds via polling
- **Auto-expiry** — entries older than 2 hours are pruned from localStorage on next `getActivePickupQueue()` call
- **Manual Clear on display** — first click shows "Confirm?" (red), second click removes the entry from localStorage; disappears on all open display tabs within 2 seconds
- **Background Checks tab** — volunteers with expired or near-expiry checks shown with amber/red indicators
- **Director Override** — staff can move a checked-in child to a different room from the roster; reason logged to DB
- **Worship service builder** — song library, service plan CRUD, item reorder, team assignment, email-team action
- **Logo upload** — PNG/JPG upload in setup wizard and settings; preview shown immediately (data URL in TEST_MODE); logo appears in admin sidebar, kiosk phone entry screen, visitor form embed, and pickup display

## Session J — Giving & Finance ✅ Complete (2026-04-18)

**+38 tests (464 total).** Baseline: 426 tests.

### What was built

#### giving-service.ts

New service at `src/features/giving/giving-service.ts`:
- CRUD wrappers: `getGivingRecords`, `createGivingRecord`, `updateGivingRecord`, `deleteGivingRecord`
- `computeGivingSummary(records)` — pure function, no DB: YTD total, last-12-months monthly buckets, fund breakdown sorted by total desc with percentages
- `getAnnualGivingStatement(personId, year)` — tax-year scoped records + by-fund breakdown
- `parseGivingCsv(csv)` — RFC-4180 Planning Center CSV parser; handles quoted commas, `$`/`,` in amounts, ISO and M/D/YYYY dates
- `commitGivingImport(rows)` — name-matched DB insert with `source: 'imported'`; returns `{ created, skipped }`
- `formatCurrency`, `formatMethod` — display helpers
- **Bug fixed**: `splitCsvRows` was stripping quote characters before passing rows to `parseCsvRow`, breaking quoted fields with commas. Fixed by preserving `"` in the accumulated row string.

#### GivingDashboard.tsx

Three-tab UI at `/admin/giving` (Finance Admin + giving module required):
- **Records tab** — filterable table (person/fund/method), inline edit/delete, `RecordForm` modal for add/edit
- **Summary tab** — YTD stat card, 12-month bar chart sparkline, fund breakdown with progress bars
- **Import tab** — embeds `GivingImport` component

#### GivingImport.tsx

Step-flow CSV importer:
- Upload step: drag-and-drop + file input, reads Planning Center CSV
- Preview step: table of parsed rows before commit, warning about unmatched names
- Done step: shows created/skipped counts

#### GivingStatements.tsx

Annual giving statement at `/admin/giving/statements`:
- Person selector + year dropdown (current + 4 prior years)
- Printable donation history table + fund summary + tax disclaimer
- `window.print()` for Print/Save PDF

#### Finance Admin gating

- Nav item: `requireFinance: true` — visible only to `isFinanceAdmin` users
- Routes: both `/admin/giving` and `/admin/giving/statements` use `requireFinanceAdmin()` loader
- PersonDetail: giving history section (`PersonGivingHistory`) conditionally rendered when `user?.isFinanceAdmin`

### Tests added (Session J)

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/tests/giving-service.test.ts` | 38 | CRUD, computeGivingSummary (YTD, monthly, fund breakdown, empty), getAnnualGivingStatement (year filter, total, empty year), parseGivingCsv (all field types, error rows, quoted commas), commitGivingImport (match, skip, source), formatCurrency, formatMethod |

---

## Session K — Monthly Vital Signs Report ✅ Complete (2026-04-18)

**+66 tests (530 total).** Baseline: 464 tests.

### What was built

#### New types + DB layer

- `MonthlyReportHistory` type — one row per month per church; `is_imported` flag distinguishes CSV-imported rows from live data snapshots
- `AppConfig` fields: `annual_giving_budget?: number`, `report_recipients?: string` (comma-separated emails)
- `DatabaseService` methods: `getMonthlyReportHistory(year?, month?)`, `upsertMonthlyReportHistory(data)`
- In-memory DB + Firebase stub implementations

#### monthly-report-service.ts

Pure calculation functions (all testable without DB):
- `countSundaysInMonth(year, month)` — counts Sundays in any calendar month
- `avgWeeklyAttendance(headcounts, sundayCount)` — sum of headcounts ÷ Sundays
- `engagementPct`, `servicePct`, `givingPct`, `kidsPct`, `studentsPct` — n / avgWeekly × 100
- `budgetPct(givingTotal, monthlyBudget)` — giving vs monthly target
- `trendArrow(current, previous)` — ↑ / ↓ / → / null
- `trendPct(current, previous)` — % change, null when no prior data
- `parseHistoricalCsv(csv)` — validates year/month required columns, parses 7 optional numeric columns, row-level errors don't block other rows
- `commitHistoricalImport(rows)` — upserts rows to DB as `is_imported: true`

DB-dependent aggregation:
- `getAttendanceHeadcountsForMonth(year, month)` — reads AttendanceEntry.auditorium_count
- `getEngagedPeopleInMonth(year, month)` — groups that held meetings; if individual attendance recorded use 'present' records; otherwise count all active members
- `getCheckinKidsInMonth(year, month)` — CheckinSession → Checkin → Person.grade; deduplicates within month; splits by KIDS_GRADES (Pre-K–5th) and STUDENT_GRADES (6th–12th)
- `computeMonthlyReport(year, month, monthlyBudget?)` — aggregates all five sections into MonthlyReportData
- `getStoredMonthData(year, month)` — fallback to MonthlyReportHistory for prior-period comparisons

#### MonthlyReport.tsx (`/admin/reports/monthly`)

- Month/year selector (current + 4 prior years)
- Five metric sections: Attendance, Engagement, Service, Giving, Kids & Students
- Trend arrows on every metric with a prior period; N/A shown gracefully
- Attendance comparisons: vs previous month, vs rolling 12-month average, vs same month last year
- Giving section: Finance Admin sees dollar amounts and budget %; other Staff see participation rate only
- Budget color: green ≥100%, amber 80–99%, red <80%
- "Print / PDF" button → `window.print()` with print-optimized layout (church logo/name header, no nav chrome)
- "Email report" button → sends HTML email to `config.report_recipients` (alerts if not configured)
- "Import historical data" button → 3-step modal (upload CSV → row-by-row preview → done count)
- Links to `/admin/attendance`, `/admin/giving`, `/admin/checkin` when data is missing for the selected month

#### Navigation + Settings

- **Reports** nav item in AdminLayout sidebar (Staff+, chart icon, before Import)
- **Settings → Dashboard & Reports section**: annual giving budget field + year-over-year toggle
- **Settings → Communications section**: Report Recipients field (comma-separated emails for monthly report)

### Tests added (Session K)

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/tests/monthly-report.test.ts` | 66 | countSundaysInMonth (5 tests), avgWeeklyAttendance (6), engagementPct/servicePct/givingPct/budgetPct/kidsPct/studentsPct (11), trendArrow/trendPct (9), parseHistoricalCsv (12), commitHistoricalImport (2), getAttendanceHeadcountsForMonth (3), getEngagedPeopleInMonth (3), getCheckinKidsInMonth (3), computeMonthlyReport (5), grade classification constants (3) |

## Session O — One-Click Email Confirmation Wiring ✅ Complete (2026-04-22)

**+13 tests (645 total).** Baseline: 632 tests.

### Context

The confirmation token infrastructure (`confirmation-token-service.ts`, `ConfirmPage.tsx`, DB methods, tests) was already fully built in a prior session. What was missing was the **email wiring** — the service-layer functions that create tokens and embed confirm/decline URLs in outbound emails.

### What was built

#### `volunteer-service.ts` — `sendVolunteerScheduleEmail`

New exported function that coordinators can call after scheduling a volunteer:
- Looks up the `VolunteerSchedule` entry and the person
- Creates a `ConfirmationToken` with `purpose=volunteer` via `createVolunteerConfirmToken`
- Sends a personalized email with two one-click URLs in the body
- Marks `reminder_sent: true` and `reminder_sent_at` on the schedule entry
- No-ops silently if the person has no email on file or the schedule ID is invalid

#### `group-service.ts` — updated `promoteFromWaitlist`

When a group slot opens and a waitlisted member is promoted to `active`:
- **Before:** sent a plain text email with no action links
- **After:** creates a `ConfirmationToken` with `purpose=group_waitlist`, embeds confirm/decline URLs in the email body. If they click "Release my spot", the token resolution sets `status: inactive`. SMS still sent as a brief heads-up pointing to the email.

#### `event-service.ts` — updated `cancelRegistration`

When a waitlisted registrant is promoted to `registered`:
- **Before:** sent a plain text email
- **After:** creates a `ConfirmationToken` with `purpose=event`, embeds confirm/decline URLs. If they click "Release my spot", the token resolution sets `status: cancelled`. SMS still sent as a brief heads-up.

### Tests added (Session O)

`src/tests/email-confirmation-wiring.test.ts` — 13 tests:

**`sendVolunteerScheduleEmail`** (6):
- Email body contains `/confirm?token=`, `action=confirm`, `action=decline`
- Subject contains role and service date
- No-ops when schedule ID is invalid
- No-ops when person has no email
- Body includes volunteer first name
- `reminder_sent` flag and timestamp set on entry after send

**Group waitlist promotion** (3):
- Promoted person receives email with confirm/decline URLs
- Email mentions the group name
- No email sent when promoted person has no email address

**Event waitlist promotion** (3):
- Promoted person receives email with confirm/decline URLs
- Email mentions the event name
- No email sent when promoted person has no email address

### Already-existing coverage (not new, but relevant)

- `src/tests/merge-fields.test.ts` — 14 tests: `replaceMergeFields`, `MERGE_FIELDS` array, all token types, edge cases
- `src/tests/confirmation-token.test.ts` — 26 tests: URL helpers, token creation for all 3 purposes, expiry TTL, uniqueness, `resolveConfirmationToken` (confirm/decline for volunteer/event/group_waitlist, not_found, already_used, expired, single-use guarantee)

## Session N — Bulk Messaging UI ✅ Complete (2026-04-19)

**+32 tests (632 total).** Baseline: 600 tests.

### What was built

#### Type additions (`src/shared/types/index.ts`)
- Added `is_bulk?`, `recipient_count?`, `sender_name?` to `CommunicationsLogEntry`
- Added new `EmailTemplate` interface (id, church_id, name, subject, body, created_at, updated_at)

#### DB layer
- `db-interface.ts`: Added `getEmailTemplates()`, `saveEmailTemplate()`, `deleteEmailTemplate()`
- `in-memory-db.ts`: Implemented all three methods with `gather_email_templates` localStorage key using `mergeIntoStore` pattern; added `emailTemplates` to the store
- `firebase-db.ts`: Added `notImplemented` stubs for all three methods

#### `notification-service.ts`
- Added `options?: { skipLog?: boolean }` parameter to `sendEmail`
- When `skipLog: true`, the per-message `logNotification` call is skipped (used by bulk sends to prevent N individual log entries)

#### `bulk-messaging-service.ts` (new — `src/features/communications/`)

Pure audience filter functions (all unit-tested):
- `filterAllMembers(people)` — active, non-child, non-archived
- `filterAllVolunteers(people, teamMembers)` — anyone on any team
- `filterAllGroupLeaders(people, groups)` — anyone who is `leader_id` of a group
- `filterVisitorsLastNDays(people, days, refDate?)` — people with `first_visit_date` within N days
- `filterGroupMembers(people, groupMembers, groupId)` — active members of specific group
- `filterTeamVolunteers(people, teamMembers, teamId)` — members of specific team
- `filterBirthdayThisMonth(people, refDate?)` — `date_of_birth` month matches current month
- `renderForRecipient(template, person, churchName)` — renders merge fields for one person

DB-aware functions:
- `resolveAudienceFromDb(filter)` — resolves any `AudienceFilter` against the live DB
- `sendBulkEmail(recipients, subject, body, senderName, churchName)` — sends personalized emails with `skipLog: true`, writes one summary `CommunicationsLogEntry` with `is_bulk: true`

#### `BulkMessageModal.tsx` (new — `src/features/communications/`)

Four-step modal wizard:
- **Step 1 — Audience**: Radio buttons for all 7 filter types; sub-controls for days/group/team selectors; live recipient count that updates as filter changes; zero-audience warning blocks Next
- **Step 2 — Compose**: Subject + body textarea; merge field insert buttons ({first_name}, {last_name}, {church_name}, etc.); template picker (loads saved templates); "Save as template" flow with name input; SMS option shown but disabled with "Coming soon" label
- **Step 3 — Preview**: Renders first 5 email-having recipients with merge fields substituted
- **Step 4 — Confirm & send**: Summary table (recipients, with-email count, subject, sender); disabled send button when no email addresses; progress indicator while sending; success screen with sent/failed counts

#### `CommunicationsLog.tsx` (updated)
- Added "**+ New message**" button in page header that opens `BulkMessageModal`
- After a bulk send completes, log is refreshed
- Bulk entries displayed with a purple **BULK** badge alongside the channel badge
- Recipient column shows "N recipients" for bulk entries instead of email address

### Tests added (Session N)

`src/tests/bulk-messaging.test.ts` — 32 tests:
- `filterAllMembers` (5): active adults only, excludes children/archived/inactive, empty input
- `filterAllVolunteers` (4): team membership, no team, duplicate teams, excludes children
- `filterAllGroupLeaders` (3): leader detection, non-leaders, empty groups
- `filterVisitorsLastNDays` (5): within window, outside window, exact cutoff, no visit date, excludes children
- `filterGroupMembers` (3): active members only, waitlisted/inactive excluded, empty
- `filterTeamVolunteers` (3): team scoping, empty team, excludes archived
- `filterBirthdayThisMonth` (4): matching month, different month, no DOB, excludes children
- `renderForRecipient` (5): first_name, last_name, church_name, no fields, multiple fields

## Session M — CCLI Song Usage Report ✅ Complete (2026-04-19)

**+31 tests (600 total).** Baseline: 569 tests.

### What was built

#### ccli-report-service.ts (`src/features/worship/ccli-report-service.ts`)

Pure functions:
- `defaultDateRange()` — today back 6 months using local date arithmetic
- `filterPlansByDateRange(plans, from, to)` — inclusive YYYY-MM-DD string comparison
- `aggregateSongUsage(plans, items, songMap)` — groups song items by song_id; `timesUsed` = total appearances; `serviceDates` = sorted deduplicated list; unknown songs appear as "Unknown Song"; rows sorted by timesUsed desc then title asc
- `formatCcliCsv(rows)` — RFC-4180 CSV with header `Title,Artist,CCLI Number,Times Used,Service Dates`; service dates joined with `; `; all string fields double-quoted with `""` escaping

Async function:
- `computeCcliReport(from, to)` — fetches plans, filters, fetches items per plan, resolves songs via `db.getSong()` (not `getSongs()` so soft-deleted songs are included)

Types exported: `CcliSongRow`, `CcliReport`

#### CcliReport.tsx (`/admin/worship/ccli`)

- Date range pickers defaulting to last 6 months
- Permanent compliance banner: "Gather Vital tracks your song usage but does not automatically file CCLI reports..."
- Summary line: "X songs used across Y services in this period"
- Table: Song Title, Artist/Author, CCLI # (⚠ Not set for missing), Times Used, Services Used In
- Yellow warning banner when any song lacks a CCLI number
- Download CSV button (triggers browser download of `ccli-usage-{from}-to-{to}.csv`)
- Print Report button (`window.print()`) with print-optimized layout (church name + date range header, no nav chrome)
- Empty state with link to service planning when no songs found

#### Navigation

- **CCLI Report** tab added to WorshipDashboard tab bar
- **CCLI Report** nav item in AdminLayout sidebar (Staff+, worship module, document icon)
- **CCLI Report** link button added to SongLibrary header
- Route: `admin/worship/ccli` as child of WorshipDashboard (inherits tab bar)

#### SETUP.md

- Added Section 17 explaining CCLI licensing: what it is, why churches need it, how to get a license, how to file the bi-annual report using Gather Vital's export, how to add CCLI numbers to songs

### Tests added (Session M)

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/tests/ccli-report.test.ts` | 31 | filterPlansByDateRange (7), aggregateSongUsage (13), formatCcliCsv (8), defaultDateRange (2), edge cases: unknown songs, non-song items, items without song_id, items outside plan set |

---

## Session L — Sunday Volunteer Run Sheet ✅ Complete (2026-04-18)

**+39 tests (569 total).** Baseline: 530 tests.

### What was built

#### New types + DB layer

- `service_time_id?: string` added to `VolunteerSchedule` — allows assignments to be filtered by service time

#### runsheet-service.ts (`src/features/volunteers/runsheet-service.ts`)

Pure functions:
- `isFirstTimeInRole(entry, allHistory)` — true if no prior `served === true` record in same position before this date
- `filterByServiceTime(entries, serviceTimeId)` — null/empty returns all; entries without `service_time_id` appear in every view
- `groupEntriesByTeam(entries, allTeams, teamMembersMap, allHistory)` — groups by team_id; detects leads via `role === 'leader' | 'coordinator'`; sorts leads first then alpha by last name; `confirmedCount` excludes declined; `totalCount` excludes both cancelled and declined
- `nextServiceDate(serviceTimes, fromDate)` — finds next calendar date matching a service day; uses local date arithmetic (`new Date(y, m, d+i)`) to avoid UTC midnight timezone shifts; defaults to Sunday when no service times configured
- `isKidsTeam(team)` — true if team name contains "kids" (case-insensitive)

Types exported: `RunSheetEntry`, `RunSheetTeamGroup`

#### RunSheet.tsx (`/admin/volunteers/runsheet`)

- Date selector defaulting to next upcoming service date
- Service time filter (shown only when >1 service time exists; "All services" default)
- Volunteers grouped by team, sorted leads first then alpha
- Per-volunteer row: checkbox (on-screen), name with badges (★ lead, confirmed checkmark, NEW first-time, Declined muted), role/position, phone number
- Kids teams show room alongside role
- Team header: "X of Y confirmed" count
- Checking a box calls `markServed(id, true)`; unchecking calls `markServed(id, null)`
- Restores `checkedIn` state from `entry.served === true` on load
- Live summary banner: "X of Y checked in" across all visible teams
- Reset all button clears all check-ins
- Print layout: Tailwind `print:hidden` / `print:block` classes; empty checkboxes, badges, phone numbers, no nav chrome

#### Navigation

- **Run Sheet** button in VolunteerDashboard schedule tab (links to `/admin/volunteers/runsheet`)
- **Run Sheet** nav item in AdminLayout sidebar (clipboard icon, Staff+, `moduleKey: 'volunteers'`)
- Route: `admin/volunteers/runsheet` — Staff+, wrapped in `<Wrap>`

### Tests added (Session L)

| File | Tests | Coverage |
|------|-------|---------|
| `src/tests/runsheet.test.ts` | 39 | isFirstTimeInRole (7), filterByServiceTime (5), groupEntriesByTeam (11), confirmation status display (3), served status update integration (3), nextServiceDate (6), isKidsTeam (2), service time filtering integration (2) |

## Up Next — Build Queue

> **Music Stand is fully operational end to end.** PDF.js renders every chord chart as real pages with a transparent annotation canvas. Worship leaders can highlight, draw, and add text notes that persist across sessions.

### Immediate Queue

1. **Annotation UX polish** — eraser tool, undo/redo (Ctrl+Z), annotation list panel for reviewing/deleting individual marks
2. **Multi-device annotation sync** — push real-time annotation updates to other musicians in the same session via standBus

> **Recommended: Home church trial before Phase 7.**
> The core feature set is now substantial enough for real use. Running the app with an actual congregation (even a small one) for 2–4 weeks will surface friction, missing edge cases, and priority mismatches that are hard to anticipate in isolation. Suggested trial checklist:
> - Run the setup wizard end-to-end for your church
> - Check in kids for at least one service
> - Log volunteer schedules and confirm/decline flows
> - Create a worship service plan and open it in Music Stand on a real device
> - Import your song library from Planning Center
> - Log group attendance for a small group
>
> Observations from the trial should inform whether bulk PDF upload or Phase 7 (Giving) comes first.

### Phase 7 — Giving Module (`/admin/giving`)

Giving records, Finance Admin access control, and Planning Center giving import.

**What to build:**
- Giving record CRUD: amount, date, fund, method (cash/check/card/online), person link
- Finance Admin gate: `isFinanceAdmin` flag required — hidden from all other tiers including Executive
- Giving dashboard widget: total YTD, monthly trend sparkline, top funds breakdown
- CSV import from Planning Center giving export format (reuse `song-import-service` CSV parser pattern)
- Individual giving history on `PersonDetail.tsx` (Finance Admin only)
- Annual giving statement view per person (printable, tax-year scoped)

**Data model:** `GivingRecord` entity already exists in types and in-memory DB — UI and access control only.

**Routes:** `/admin/giving`, `/admin/giving/import`, `/admin/giving/statements`

---

### Phase 8 — Distribution Polish

Things to finish before wider rollout:

- **Firebase implementation** — fill in the `notImplemented` stubs in `firebase-db.ts` for all methods added since Phase 1 (groups, worship, music stand, group attendance, giving)
- **PWA manifest + service worker** — Music Stand already caches plans offline; wire up a proper web app manifest so it installs to the home screen on iOS/Android
- **Email templates** — the notification service sends plain text; add HTML templates for visitor follow-up, volunteer schedule confirmation, and group signup notifications
- **Print label production path** — `print-server/` exists and works in TEST_MODE; document the PrintNode setup and test with a real Zebra printer
- **Role management UI** — currently tiers are set by a developer; add a simple Admin page to assign roles to people records
- **Error boundaries and loading states** — audit pages for missing error boundaries and add skeleton loading states for slow network conditions

## Known Gaps / Not Yet Built

### In-Scope, Deferred to Upcoming Sessions
- **Session D — Music Stand Mode** — `/display/service` read-only service plan view for worship team
- **Session E — Small Group Attendance** — per-meeting attendance log, rate tracking, CSV export
- **Phase 7 — Giving** — giving records, Finance Admin access, giving statements, Planning Center import

### Firebase / Production Wiring
`src/services/firebase-db.ts` exists as a stub but is not fully implemented. To go to production:
1. Complete `firebase-db.ts` against Firestore / RTDB
2. Replace BroadcastChannel/localStorage cross-tab sync with Firebase `onSnapshot`
3. Wire real Firebase Authentication in `AuthContext.tsx`
4. The Resend email key (`VITE_RESEND_API_KEY`) is browser-exposed — proxy through a Firebase Cloud Function for production deployments

### Test Gaps
- No tests for kiosk React components (`KioskApp`, `PhoneEntry`, etc.)
- No tests for `CheckinDashboard`, `CheckinRoster`, `CheckoutPanel`
- Cross-tab behavior cannot be tested in jsdom (single module scope) — manually verified
- No tests for `PickupDisplay` React component (tested at the service layer only)

### Minor UX Gaps
- `admin/people` filter by household (`?household=...`) is not implemented
- The new-family kiosk flow generates a pickup code at registration time and again at check-in; only the `Checkin.pickup_code` matters for pickup — the `ChildPickup.pickup_code` is unused during the session
- Music Stand Mode (Session D) — built at `/stand`; see Session D section above
